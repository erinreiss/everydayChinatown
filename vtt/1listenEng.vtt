00:00:06.00 —> 00:00:11.00 align:middle line:90%
most of them pack their goods
in this kind of bag.

00:00:11.00 —> 00:00:15.00 align:middle line:90%
It’s cheap… but strong.
(Yeah.)

One thing, they are waterproof
Other thing, light.

And then, cheap!
And strong.

like that… Very cheap.

This handle is all the way around,
so that’s why it makes it very strong.

The workmanship like that,
it won’t break.

In the airport, or any travel hotspot,
when you see these bags…

00:00:48.00 —> 00:00:52.00 align:middle line:90%
You can see all Chinese there.
